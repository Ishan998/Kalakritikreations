        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Chikankari is a traditional embroidery style from Lucknow, known for its soft,
          detailed handwork. It is done using white or colored threads on light fabrics like cotton, muslin, or chiffon.
          What makes Chikankari special is its fine stitches like Bakhiya, Phanda, and Keel, which form beautiful floral
          and leaf designs. Each pattern is carefully made by hand, and depending on the design, it can take a few days
          to even weeks to finish one piece. This art is not just stitching it's a slow and graceful process that
          reflects skill, tradition, and beauty, making every outfit feel unique and elegant.</p>

        <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">History Of Chikankari</h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Chikankari, the beautiful hand embroidery that Lucknow is famous for, has its
          roots in the Mughal era. The story begins in the 17th century with Noor Jahan, the wife of Emperor Jahangir.
          Noor Jahan was not just a queen but also a woman of great taste and creativity. She had a deep love for art,
          design, and fashion. It is believed that she brought the art of Chikankari from Persia (modern-day Iran) to
          India.

          Noor Jahan introduced this delicate embroidery style to the royal court. Inspired by the fine white-on-white
          floral designs of Persian embroidery, she encouraged local artisans to learn and develop this craft. With her
          support, Chikankari began to flourish in the Mughal courts, especially in the Awadh region, where Lucknow is
          located. Over time, it became a symbol of elegance, grace, and royal beauty.

          The art of Chikankari involves intricate hand-stitching on light fabrics like muslin, cotton, and silk. The
          designs often feature flowers, vines, and geometric patterns. Back then, the embroidery was done using white
          threads on white fabric, giving it a rich yet subtle charm.

          As the Mughals ruled for centuries, this art spread among common people too. Women in villages and towns began
          to learn Chikankari and pass it on through generations. Today, Lucknow is still the heart of Chikankari, where
          thousands of artisans carry forward the legacy started by Noor Jahan. Her love for beauty and craftsmanship
          gave India one of its most treasured hand arts.</p>

          <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Hand-stitched Chikankari from Lucknow is a timeless embroidery art passed
            down through generations. Known for its delicate, shadow like stitches, it is done by hand on soft,
            breathable fabrics like cotton, muslin, georgette, and chiffon using fine cotton or silk threads.
            The process begins with block printing the design, followed by intricate hand embroidery using over 30
            traditional stitches such as bakhiya, phanda, and murri.
            Each piece is unique, reflecting skilled craftsmanship, patience, and heritage. Chikankari’s elegance,
            authenticity, and lightweight comfort make it popular globally as both luxury ethnic wear and modern
            fashion. Its growing demand comes from its artistic charm, cultural significance, and slow-fashion appeal
            that values quality over mass production.

          <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Machine stitched Chikankari began gaining popularity in the early 2000s
            as a quicker, cheaper alternative to traditional hand embroidery. Unlike the original handwork that takes
            days and showcases fine craftsmanship, machine embroidery is mass-produced in hours and lacks the intricate
            charm of real Chikankari.
            This shift led to a rise in fake products, where machine made items are falsely sold as handmade, confusing
            customers and harming the reputation of authentic Lucknow Chikankari.
            As a result, many skilled artisans have faced reduced demand and income, threatening this centuries old art
            form. While machine work may be affordable, it lacks the cultural soul and depth of traditional embroidery,
            which deserves recognition and support to keep the heritage alive.</p>
